					<h2>Initial Thoughts</h2>
					<p>
						In Japan, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Samurai arts and culture.  Naturally, Samurai-inspired fashion was a great blend of utility and aesthetic.  When I visited the Samurai Ninja Museum 
						in Kyoto, I learned how much utility a Samurai's clothing served.  Favoring sleek, simplistic appearances, I also
						 found Samurai wear to be aesthetically pleasing.
					</p>  
					<p>
						I was also inspired by streetwear, a fashion trend that I found to be both functional and aesthetic.  As someone who values fashion that's useful, 
						I wanted to create designs that fit within this purpose.  The following collection features Hakamas, Kimonos, and Haoris.  
						While the garments aren't necessarily intended to be used in combat, the design choices are influenced by features of Samurai clothing.  I also wanted to blend that simplicity with
						my like for hardware accessories and edgy streetwear.

							<h3>What is Y&#363;gen?</h3>
							<p>
						  		Y&#363;gen is a Japanese aesthetic centered around darkness and mystery.
						  		It's the beauty that lies beyond the surface.
							</p>
							<p>
						  		Y&#363;gen prompts one to question the beauty of things beyond the superficial.

							<h3>What makes Y&#363;gen?</h3>
							<p>
						  		There isn't one concrete way to characterize this concept, but some features that can be considered Y&#363;gen are:
						  		"unpainted blank space, simplification, asymmetry, irregularity, imperfection, quiet colors, composition, gold paint"
						  		(from <span class="source">nomurakakejiku</span>).

							<h3>The point of design in fashion</h3>
							<p>Good fashion intends to serve a purpose, to facilitate use in daily life while presenting a desired aesthetic value.</p>

							<h3>1. Innovative</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The purpose of my line is to re-imagine what modern-day Samurai wear could look like, using modern aesthetics and Samurai functionality.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>2. Aesthetic</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Each item I've designed follows a thematic pattern: dark and mysterious.  I tend to favor darker colors, as they're versatile and make one look fiercer and more intimidating.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>3. Unobtrusive</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Samurai often have to move quickly and discreetly, and in general, clothing should not be a hindrance.  From wide-legged hakama pants to flowy haoris and kimonos, this line
							prioritizes a wearer's comfort by staying out of the way.  Rather, moving along with the wearer.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>4. Long-Lasting</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							A major issue with the fashion industry is that it values fast fashion.  Fashion meant to be used and thrown, rather than used for a long time.  In my 
							design, I sought to use materials that last, such as cotton and leather over polyester and synthetic materials, to give someone a garment for life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, by relying on a timeless aesthetic such as Samurai fashion, these garments are timeless.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>5. Environmentally-Friendly</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							In line with the previous point, long-lasting materials tend to be environmentally-friendly.  By creating garments to last in closets and not in landfills, 
							a positive environmental impact is created.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>6. Useful</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I deeply prioritize the use of clothing.  As a result, all pants have multiple pockets, and each kimono and haori is meant to be used.  Especially 
							in regards to movement, designed to be moved with the body.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>7. Understandable</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Streetwear runs the risk of not being understood by a wearer, especially when there are a ton of straps and buckles.  By relying on simple design, 
							garments structured similar to existing modern clothing, and following a thematic color scheme, these are items wearers can put on and style easily.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>8. Honest</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							My intentions with what I designed are clear.  By creating an interactive page with hitpoints, people can see the thoughts that went 
							into the design, enabling transparency.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>9. Thorough Down to the Last Detail</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I thought a lot about not just how these clothes would look but how they would be used.  This is a detail that often gets overlooked 
							in fashion design, especially design meant to be admired on a runway.  To me, this means being detailed.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<header>
							<h3>10. As Little Design as Possible</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Effective fashion design isn't overly done.  While I have included metallic hardware, which can be considered superfluous, I wanted to ensure that it 
							had a purpose.  Whether it is symbolic or functional.  Minimal design on separate clothing components also ensures that people can style them 
							however fits their aesthetic best.
