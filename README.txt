This website, a final project for CRCP 3360, is a portfolio of aesthetic and design insights gained from Japan.  I chose to design clothes inspired by Japanese Samurai and streetwear (my favorite fashion trend).  Key points I wanted to emphasize with this work are:

- Aesthetics: Japanese aesthetics centered around simplicity, mystery, and awareness
- Good design: functional clothes where design choices are made based on utility
- Samurai: appearance and utility based on use by a Samurai (despite ultimately being designed for general use and wear)
